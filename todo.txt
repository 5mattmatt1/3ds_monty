A much needed edit to the todo.txt
It seems like everything has been thought through fairly well except for documentation so I plan on documenting the shit out of everything
Please refer to documentation.txt for all info atm
Maybe when I have compiled enough information I can get Varun to help me manage an .html document for all of the stuff I will need to document
