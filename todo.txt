I feel like a large amount of things have been neglected to maintain this project.
Along with doing my absolute best to add comments as much as possible to the code that is wrapping everything together 
I also plan on doing what I can to update it.
Main thing I want to do is create a basic engine called Smaragd (German word for Emerald) that would help handle all the important parts of
game development and would be heavily based off of pygame and would aim to allow pygame projects to easily transition over to
the 3ds. There also might be future work to try to get work on porting RPGMaker projects to work this way as well. This will of course 
require a rewrite of the main RPGMaker engine into Micropython and use Smaragd bindings but shouldn't be too hard to make SmaragdRPG.
